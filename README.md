## To install Meteor.js run the command:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

## To run the app:
```
meteor
```

## To run test: (I was not able to get tests working for this assignment)

```
meteor test --driver-package=practicalmeteor:mocha
```

## My comparison to Angular:
  Meteor is very fast! It was cool to run the "meteor" command which starts the server, mongodb and builds and starts your app on localhost:3000.

  When you create a new project it includes template files to get you started quickly which is really cool.

  When running the "meteor" command it automatically rebuilds and restarts your server with each change you make or new package you add. Its like gulp but it is all handled for you.

  It has handlebar like templating system like Angular but Meteor only uses one-way data binding and believe that was design decision as two-way data bind can complicate certain things or so I have read I am not sure what they are specifically.

  There is no creating custom HTML tags/directives in Meteor that I am aware of.

  The documentation for Meteor.js is pretty helpful and its filled with good examples to help you out.
